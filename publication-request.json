    "introduction" : "There is a growing need for representing the ICHOM Patient-Centered Outcome Measure Sets through HL7 FHIR APIs for the international community. The clinical elements of the ICHOM Patient-centered Outcomes Measures are already created and accepted as per international clinical research, patient represented and peer-reviewed process (akin to HL7 balloting process). Mapping to standard ontologies, such as SNOMED, are part of the already peer-reviewed and internationally accepted measure set. What is sought is the development and publishing of the HL7 FHIR representation of the already internationally validated and peer-reviewed ICHOM patient-centered outcome measure set for breast cancer."
