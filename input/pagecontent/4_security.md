ICHOM created Patient-Centered Outcome Measure Sets to compare performance globally, allow clinicians to learn from each other, and rapidly improve healthcare for patients. The breast cancer set includes both clinical and patient-reported outcomes. 

This is a domain of knowledge IG, focused only on representing ICHOM Breast Cancer Set elements in FHIR and not supporting any specific usecases. As a result, extensive security measures are out of scope, and the responsibility for safe storage and transmission of patient data as applicable to a given usecase falls upon the implementers.
