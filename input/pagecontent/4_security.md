ICHOM created Patient-Centered Outcome Measure Sets to compare performance globally, allow clinicians to learn from each other, and rapidly improve healthcare for patients. The breast cancer set includes both clinical and patient-reported outcomes. 

The FHIR artifacts in this implementation guide contain limited patient-specific information. As a result, extensive security measures are out of scope and the responsibility for safe storage of patient data falls upon the implementers.
